# Giant Bomb redirects

This project and its associated websites are no longer active. Please feel
free to fork it should you wish to carry the torch.

_Original README:_

This is a page that lists URLs that redirect to giantbomb.com or associated
destinations. It's based on a very similar page I did for Waypoint redirects.

The page exists under a number of aliases:

~[explosion.zone](https://explosion.zone)~  
~[haunted.domains/suıɐɯop˙pǝʇunɐɥ](https://haunted.domains/suıɐɯop˙pǝʇunɐɥ)~  
~[haunted.domains/gb](https://haunted.domains/gb)~  
~[somewhat.haunted.domains](https://somewhat.haunted.domains)~  
~[slightly.haunted.domains](https://slightly.haunted.domains)~  

Please feel free to make your own contributions. I try to keep it up-to-date,
but I'm not too involved in chat or the community at large, so I miss a fair
amount of stuff.

It's pretty straightforward. `index.php` pulls from a few plaintext lists to
build the various sections of the page. `!` at the start of a line marks that
URL as dead (i.e. non-clickable, formatted with a strikethrough).

If you do make an edit, please keep things alphabetical.
